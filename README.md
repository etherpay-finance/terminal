# Terminal

Have you ever wondered why you need Visa or Mastercard? Why do you need to lease a terminal to process payments? Why do you need to pay a hefty fee for getting your payment processed?

The Îž Terminal is the first crypto native application to enhance the payments experience. The only fee you pay is the fee for the transaction itself on the blockchain. Thanks to L2 support this now costs pennies and maybe even lower than that in the future.

The application currently supports:

- Payment amount entry in USD
- Payments in blockchain native token ETH
- Ethereum as well as its L2 such as Optimism and Arbitrum
- Notification on successful payment


The features to be added:

- Payment amount entry in other fiat currencies: EUR, GBP, YEN, CNY
- History of payments that have been made through the terminal
- The full support for EIP-681
  - Payments in ERC20 tokens
  - The smart payments:
    - Automatic staking of ETH
    - Automatic conversion to another token e.g. accepting payment in ETH and converting it to a stable coin right away
    - Automatic deposits to AAVE, COMPOUND
